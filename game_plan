um. this is for game design planning and stuff. 

So basically I have noo idea what I'm doing, but you are a character in the world of Astavere. You've been selected for a prophesied quest, which I should probably figure out lmao. Depending on your player stats you are able to make certain decisions regarding your current predicament. Predicaments include:
	- battles with monsters/humans
	- puzzle stuff
	- npc dialogue
	- what foods you can make
